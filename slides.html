# Outline

Fast convolution layer forward pass in MxNet


You are required to implement optimized convolutional layer for a 2 layer convolution neural network. We will be classifying fashion mnist dataset for this project. 

##Parameters that you must be aware of:

Input channels   -  1

Input size       -  72x72 

Kernel size      -  7x7 

Filters          -  different sizes. (your code should support it)

# Project Release

## Project Landing Page
[https://github.com/illinois-impact/ece408_project](https://github.com/illinois-impact/ece408_project)

Includes 
* Instructions
* RAI Client
* Final Project Rubric
* Other Guidelines
* Skeleton Code

---

# rai Client

The client may be downloaded from the project readme

You will need your `.rai_profile` file in your home directory.
* `~/.rai_profile` on Linux/macOS
* `%HOME%/.rai_profile` on Windows

This should have been emailed to you.

(demo)

---

# Teams

## Team of 3 People

Submit your team name to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/NsjlmP4IIt1YKCf63)

Modify `.rai_profile` with your team name under `team.name`:

    profile:
      firstname: Zaid
      lastname: Qureshi
      username: zaidq2
      email: zaidq2@illinois.edu
      access_key: auth0|5a0130d32327ea70420b71ef
      secret_key: <snip>
      affiliation: uiuc
      team:
        name: staff

# Basic `rai`

`rai -p <project folder>` --queue rai_amd64_ece408 uploads your folder to AWS/IMPACT Servers.

Your code in `rai_build.yml` is executed on AWS (or IMPACT Servers) in a specific docker container.

The results are streamed back to you in *real time*.

---


# Milestone 1 (Wed 10/24/2018 @ 5pm)

* Make sure rai is working for you
* Choose your teams / team name

## Run MxNet baseline CPU code

* Make sure MxNet is working. 
* Report execution time.

## Run MxNet baseline GPU code

* Make sure MxNet GPU is working
* Report execution time.

## Show your stuff in `report.pdf`

* please make this a pdf file

(demo)

---

# Submitting

`rai -p <project folder> --queue rai_amd64_ece408 --submit=[m1,m2,m3,m4,final]`
    
    * Enforces a particular rai_build.yml
    * Records timing information
    * You will need a `report.pdf`.

Your code should work correctly here, this is what matters.

We'll look at the latest one before the deadline.

---

# Milestone 2 (Wed 11/07/2018 @ 5pm)

Turn in an updated `report.pdf`

## Implement CPU forward pass

* Make sure you can compile/run MxNet CPU code.
* Execution time

Should be pretty straightforward copy from slides / chapter 16

## Intro to `nvprof`

* Use nvprof to collect some basic info

---

# Milestone 3 (Wed 11/16/2018 @ 5pm)

Turn in an updated draft of `report.pdf`.

## Implement GPU forward pass

* Make sure you can compile/run MxNet GPU code.
* Execution time, profile

Doesn't have to be fast, but it should work.
Small changes to milestone 2.


---

# Milestone 4 (Sun 12/2/2018)

Updated `report.pdf`

## Implement 3 GPU optimizations

Use `nvprof` / NVVP to describe effect of optimizations

---

# Final Submission (Fri 12/14/2018)

* The **real deal**.

Optimize that GPU convolution. 

Turn in a final report.


---

# Rubric

1. Milestone 1 ( 5% )
2. Milestone 2 ( 10% )
3. Milestone 3 ( 10% )
    * Optimization 1
4. Final Optimizations ( 60% )
    * Optimization 2 ( 10% )
    * Optimization 3 ( 10% )
    * Optimization 4 ( 10% )
    * Optimization 5 ( 10% )
    * Optimization 6 ( 10% )
    * Additional Optimizations / detailed insights ( 10% )
5. Performance Ranking ( 10% )
6. Report Style (10 %)
    * Clear, concise writing, good layout, and good organization will be rewarded.

---

# Optimizations Rubric

Each optimization will be graded as follows:

    * Explanation of Performance Impact ( 40% )
    * Correctness ( 60% )

---

# Ranking Rubric

Each optimization will be graded as follows:

1. The median performance will be determined (how well the class did as a whole)
2. Your performance will be converted to a number of standard deviations above/below that median (how well you did compared to the class).
3. That value will be linearly mapped into the space of 0-10 to determine the ranking grade.

---

# Final report

See project page for up-to-date rubric.


You've been building this final report through all the milestones. Keep the content from the earlier milestones, but be sure to include the following:

* Your team name
* Your team member names
* Your netids
* Your UINs

For each optimization

1. Optimization Approach and Results
    * how you identified the optimization opportunity
    * why you thought the approach would be fruitful
    * the effect of the optimization. was it fruitful, and why or why not. Use nvprof and NVVP to justify your explanation.
    * Any external references used during identification or development of the optimization
    * How your team organized and divided up this work.
2. References (as needed)
3. (Optional) Suggestions for Improving Next Year


---

# Comparing against your peers

`rai rankings`

Shows *anonymized* performance results for you and other teams.

---

# `rai` tips and tricks

## `rai -p <project folder> version

Prints the date `rai` was built

Check piazza, if your `rai` is old, download a newer one

## `rai -p <project folder> --queue rai_amd64_ece408 -d -v

Debug / verbose mode. Prints a bit of additional info while running
* the queue submitted to (should be `rai_amd64`)
* what it thinks your username and team name is

---

# Notes on `batch_size`

Don't modify the `batch_size` in the python script.

You can loop over `B` in the C/CUDA code and split it up there however you want.
