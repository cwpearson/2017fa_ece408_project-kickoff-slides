# Project Release

## Project Landing Page
[https://github.com/webgpu/2017fa_ece408](https://github.com/webgpu/2017fa_ece408)

## Includes:

Instructions

RAI Client

Final Project Rubric

Other Guidelines

Skeleton Code

---

# rai Client

The client may be downloaded from here:
[https://github.com/rai-project/rai](https://github.com/rai-project/rai)

You will need your `.rai_profile` file in your home directory.
This should have been emailed to you.

(demo)

--

`rai` uploads your folder to AWS.

Your code in `rai_build.yml` is executed on AWS in a specific docker container.

The results are streamed back to you in *real time*.

---


# Milestone 1 (Friday 11/10/2017)

Nothing to turn in until final report.

* Not much work on your part!
* Just making sure rai is working for you.

## Run MxNet baseline CPU code

* Make sure MxNet is working. 
* Report execution time.

## Run MxNet baseline GPU code

* Make sure MxNet GPU is working
* Report execution time.
* Use `nvprof` to make a profile

(demo)

---

# Milestone 2 (Friday 11/17/2017)

Nothing to turn in until final report.

## Implement CPU forward pass

* Make sure you can compile/run MxNet CPU code.
* Execution time

Should be pretty straightforward copy from slides / chapter 16

---

# Milestone 3 (Friday 12/1/2017)

Nothing to turn in until final report.

## Implement GPU forward pass

* Make sure you can compile/run MxNet GPU code.
* Execution time, profile

Doesn't have to be fast, but it should work.
Small changes to milestone 2.

---

# Final Submission (Friday 12/15/2017)

* The **real deal**.

Optimize that GPU convolution. 

`rai -p <project folder> --submit`

* Enforces a particular rai_build.yml
* Records timing information
* You will need a `report.pdf`.

---

# Final report

See project page for up-to-date rubric.


* Baseline Results
    * M1.1: mxnet CPU layer performance results (time)
    * M1.2: mxnet GPU layer performance results (time, nvprof profile)
* M2.1: your baseline cpu implementation performance results (time)
* M3.1: your baseline gpu implementation performance results (time, nvprof profile)
* Optimization Approach and Results
    * how you identified the optimization opportunity
    * why you thought the approach would be fruitful
    * the effect of the optimization. was it fruitful, and why or why not. Use nvprof as needed to justify your explanation.
    * Any external references used during identification or development of the optimization
* References (as needed)
